# Shopping Cart UI (React + TypeScript)

A simple Shopping Cart UI project built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**, inspired by [Traversy Media‚Äôs new React Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-from-the-beginning/).

## Overview

This project follows along with the Traversy Media React course, but with a few of my own tweaks:

- **TypeScript (TSX)** was used throughout (instead of JSX).
- Swapped the default fetch API for **axios** to handle all data fetching.
- Introduced a simple custom hook (mainly for useContext) for practice and code clarity.
- The rest of the logic and structure closely follows the course for learning purposes.

## Features

- üõí Product listing and shopping cart functionality
- üì¶ Fetches product data using **axios**
- ‚öõÔ∏è Written in **React 18** with **TypeScript**
- üé£ Example custom hook for context state
- üì± Responsive design (as per course)

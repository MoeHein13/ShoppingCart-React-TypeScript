# Shopping Cart UI (React + TypeScript)

## üõí Live Demo

- **Frontend:**

## Overview

This project follows the Traversy Media React course, with a few personal improvements:

- **TypeScript (TSX)** was used throughout (instead of JSX).
- Swapped the default fetch API for **axios** for all data fetching.
- **Product data is fetched from a public Vercel serverless API**‚Äîno local backend required.
- Added a custom hook (mainly for useContext) for practice and code clarity.
- The rest of the logic and structure closely follows the course for learning purposes.

## Features
